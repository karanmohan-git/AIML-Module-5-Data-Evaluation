# AIML-Module-5-Data-Evaluation
The purpose of the exercise was to understand the data in the coupns.csv file and explain findings through different visualizations.
Based on the exercise conducted, below are some of the analysis:
  a. Fewer drivers tend to accept a coupon while driving. One of the possible reason could be that they are going to and from work or are rushing due to some urgency. However this is speculation as there is not enough evidence in the data set.
  b. Another interesting observation is that drivers prefer coffee shop coupons to any other coupon available. The 2nd most popular coupon is a cheap restaurant and the carry/take away food. A very small majority of drivers would accept coupons for a restaurnt. The drivers tend to be traveling alone mostly or with friends when they accept the coupon.
  c. Seems like drivers income has a big affect on accepting coupons. Drivers earning 50k or less are highly likely to accept a coupon for a cheaper restaurant. 
  d. Weather is also a big factor. There are more coffee shop coupons acceptance on sunny days vs any other season by a huge margin. 
  e. Drivers with kids who work on Farming or Forestery barely ever accept a coupon.

In Conclusion the idea of sending coupons is good but there are too many nuances to it. Text messages could be distracting. People driving do not tend to pay attention to the phone so may missout on the coupons, and may also be driving with some urgency so may ignore the coupons. There are too many variables that may affect the acceptance. This data is not complete with all those nuances.
